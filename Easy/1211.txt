-- SOLUTION 1, need to understand why used result, did not finish, got help
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND( SUM(rating::numeric/position) / COUNT(result) ,2) AS quality,
    ROUND( COUNT(rating) FILTER (WHERE rating < 3) / COUNT(rating)::numeric*100 ,2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
    Queries
WHERE
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    query_name

-- SOLUTION 2, You were working towards here but couldn't finish, 
-- you were missing a SUM() to wrap the case when with rating
-- must cast ::numeric at the right time, the earliest division
-- Write your PostgreSQL query statement below
SELECT
    query_name,
    ROUND( SUM(rating::numeric/position) / COUNT(query_name) ,2) AS quality,
    ROUND( SUM(CASE WHEN rating < 3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / COUNT(query_name)*100 ,2) AS poor_query_percentage
FROM
    Queries
WHERE
    query_name IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    query_name
